## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project explores how **annual members and casual riders** use Cyclisticâ€™s Chicago-based bike-share service differently. Using over 5.8 million ride records from a 12-month period, I cleaned, organized, and analyzed data to identify patterns in user behavior and inform targeted marketing strategies.

The analysis was completed in **RStudio** using packages like `tidyverse`, `janitor`, and `ggplot2`, with a focus on deriving actionable insights from trip duration, frequency, seasonality, and ride timing.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Applied

- **R, RStudio** (tidyverse, dplyr, lubridate, janitor)
- Data wrangling (5.8M+ observations)
- Visualization with **ggplot2**
- Time-based trend analysis
- Insight-driven business recommendations

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Casual riders take longer rides**, especially on weekends, while **members ride more frequently** on weekdays.
- Members dominate usage in **colder months**, while casual riders surge during summer.
- **Commute hours** are peak times for both user types.
- Clear trends emerge across days of the week, with members most active Mondayâ€“Friday and casuals on weekends.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Recommendations

- **Weekend Membership Plan:** A lower-cost option for riders who only use the service on weekends.
- **Ride Length Rewards:** A points system that incentivizes long ride durations for casual users.
- **Commuter Marketing Campaign:** Promote cost savings to weekday riders to encourage membership conversion.

## âœ… Outcome

This case study demonstrates my ability to handle a large dataset, clean and analyze it using R, and draw clear conclusions backed by visuals. Itâ€™s a great example of how I apply data storytelling to solve real-world business problems.
