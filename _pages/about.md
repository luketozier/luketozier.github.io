## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luke Tozier

I'm a freelance data analyst with a background in **New Media** and a strong focus on **R, Excel, and Python**. My passion lies in transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.

Iâ€™ve contributed to academic research, including multi-visit health studies, and Iâ€™ve analyzed everything from rider behavior in bike-share systems to hydration levels in field workers.

When Iâ€™m not working with data, Iâ€™m exploring tech tools, learning new frameworks, or experimenting with automation projects.
