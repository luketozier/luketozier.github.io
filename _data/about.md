## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luke Tozier

Iâ€™m a data analyst with a background in **New Media**, and I specialize in working with **R**, **Excel**, and **Python** to explore datasets and communicate meaningful insights.

I recently completed a case study analyzing over **5.8 million bike-share records** in RStudio. I cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to uncover patterns in rider behavior, and developed recommendations to support business goals.

My strengths include:
- Turning messy data into clear answers
- Building dashboards and visuals with **ggplot2** and **Excel**
- Writing clean, readable code for analysis
- Communicating findings for both technical and non-technical audiences

Iâ€™m actively seeking freelance opportunities in:
- Data cleaning & wrangling
- Visual storytelling and dashboards
- Report generation and presentation
- Excel automation or R/Python scripting
